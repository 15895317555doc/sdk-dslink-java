# SDK

The SDK is intended for DSLink development.

## DSLink Library

This is the primary library used for DSLink development.

## Commons Library

has higher level abstractions for common specific use cases in DSLink
development.

## Historian Library

This is a very high level library that enables very quick development of
historian enabled DSLinks.

## Broker Library

This library can be used to embed the DSA broker into any application.
